                    <p class="subtitle">There’s a <b>huge difference</b> between products that can deliver and those that don’t. Some even put your safety at risk. </p>
                    <p>If you look at nearly any supplement designed to help you pass or prevent kidney stones, you’ll likely see one commonality: many contain the herb Chanca Piedra. Chanca Piedra can be amazingly powerful for preventing and eliminating kidney stones, but there’s one major problem: <b>many companies don’t use lab grade Chanca Piedra</b>. In other words, if you buy a Chanca Piedra product and aren’t sure of its source, it’s likely that it’s not as potent as it could be — because it isn’t necessarily lab grade. </p>
                    <p>Worse yet, if you choose to use one of the cheaper products out there, you run the risk of ingesting toxic chemicals that could ultimately do you more harm than good.</p>

                    <p class="title">Why Lab Grade of <span>Chanca Piedra</span><br> is so Important</p>
                    <p>Imagine that every day for lunch, you ate a fast food burger, fries, and a shake. While that may sound good, how do you think you and your body would feel? Probably tired and ready for a nap, right? Eventually, this would likely lead to a life of obesity, health issues, and many aches and pains. </p>
                    <p>But what happens if you were to replace that daily lunch with a nutritious, leafy green salad with grilled chicken, tomatoes, cucumbers, and an oil and vinegar dressing on top? How would you feel then? You’d likely have a ton of energy and feel a lot better!</p>
                    <p>The reason for the difference is simple: in the first scenario, you’re taking in a lot of things your body doesn’t need, namely fat and extra calories, while being pretty void of nutrition. However, in the second example, you’re giving your body the nutrients it needs to live a life of greater health.</p>

                        <p class="title">This is why <span>lab grade matters</span> <br>with Chanca Piedra</p>
                        <p class="text">Not only does higher grade mean that you have access to higher quality herbs — herbs that do what they’re meant to do — but it does so without exposing you to ingredients that could make you feel worse. As a result, your body responds with improved kidney health, naturally. </p>
                        <p class="text">When you give your body the purest nutrients and herbs, it responds in a more positive manner that means a life of greater kidney health (and less pain!).</p>

                    <p>The <a href="">National Kidney Foundation reports</a> that kidney stones will afflict one out of every ten people nationwide. Also, more than 500,000 people will seek medical care via our nation’s emergency rooms this year alone for issues related to kidney stones. </p>
                    <p>That being said, study after study has been conducted on the herb Chanca Piedra, many of which have found that it effectively administers numerous kidney benefits, potentially reducing the number of hospital visits required for this particular condition. </p>
                    <p>For instance, a <a href="">study</a> conducted by researchers from the Nephrology Division of a Brazilian university found that Phyllanthus niruri — another name for the Chanca Piedra herb — helps inhibit the growth of the crystals that turn into kidney stones. Thus, by taking it regularly, it can act as a preventative measure for future kidney stone issues. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, in the report <a href="" class="not-underline">“Herbal Secrets of the Rainforest”</a>, it’s revealed that Dr. Wolfram Wiemann<br>
                    of Nuremberg, Germany saw a 94% success rate of stone elimination with two weeks when<br>
                    high-grade Chanca Piedra was administered to 100 patients with kidney stones.</p>
